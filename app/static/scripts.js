/*
 its recommended to insert your important javascript in the inline.js file and the additional scripts here
 because when you compact and compress your resources the inline.js scripts will be printed directly in the page
 head using the <script> </script> and the rest javascript files will be added normally using the <script src=''></script>
 tag, for more information on how to increase your application page speed please visit
 https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/rules

 Note: if you want to add additional javascript files its recommended to add them in the /app/views/resources.js file
 although you can add them manually in the page <head>, for more information about how to manage your app resources
