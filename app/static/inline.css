/*
    its recommended to insert your important css here and the additional styles in the styles.css
    because when you compact and compress your resources these styles will be printed directly in the page head using
    the <style> tag and the rest css files will be added normally using the <link> tag, for more information on how to
    increase your application page speed please visit https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/rules

    Note: print your images/fonts urls related to this file as normal and the elegant will automatically fix them
    when it print this file content inline in your page

    Note: if you want to add additional css files its recommended to add them in the /app/views/resources.js file
    although you can add them manually in the page <head>, for more information about how to manage your app resources
