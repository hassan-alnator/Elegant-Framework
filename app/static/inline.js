/*
 its recommended to insert your important javascript here and the additional scripts in the scripts.js file
 because when you compact and compress your resources this file scripts will be printed directly in the page
 head using the <script></script> and the rest javascript files will be added normally using the <script src=''></script>
 tag, for more information on how to increase your application page speed please visit
 https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/rules

 Note: if you want to add additional javascript files its recommended to add them in the /app/views/resources.js file
 although you can add them manually in the page <head>, for more information about how to manage your app resources
