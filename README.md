# Elegant-Framework


###Why Elegant ?

Everyone knows that NodeJS is taking the lead!

Taking Javascript to the server side development with its v8 javascript engine NodeJS is taking over the enterprise.

For the past two years NodeJS had huge growth and support from the open source community, currently in use by Microsoft, VMWare, Ebay, Yahoo, and many more top tech companies.

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, but this also make it very difficult to write and learn, and may lead the developers to write an ugly and hard to understand code specially what is known as callback hell.

This is why elegant framework was built with a totally new concept that makes NodeJS code more friendly and easier for building web applications without losing the efficiency of event-driven and non-blocking I/O model.
